            <h1>The Application Language</h1>
            <h2>What is C#</h2>
            <p>C# is a modern, general-purpose programming language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks and objectives <br>that span over a variety of professions. C# is primarily used on the Windows .NET framework, although it can be applied <br>to an open source platform. This highly versatile programming language is an object-oriented programming language <br>(OOP)—which isn’t very common—and fairly new to the game, yet already a reliable <a href="https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">crowd pleaser</a>.</p>
            <h2>Brief History of C#</h2>
            <p>When compared to long-standing languages like Python and PHP, C# is a young addition to the programming family at <br>nearly twenty-one years old. The language was developed in the year 2000 by Microsoft’s Anders Hejlsberg, a Danish <br>software engineer with a history for popular creations. Anders has taken part in the creation of a handful of dependable <br>programming tools and languages, including Microsoft’s TypeScript and Delphi, a suitable replacement for Turbo Pascal.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, C# was originally titled COOL, a clever acronym that stood for “C-like Object Oriented Language.” <br>Unfortunately, Microsoft was unable to hang onto the fun name for reasons having to do with trademark law.</p>
            <p>C# was originally designed to rival Java. Judging by the quick rise to popularity and the positive response from both new <br>and seasoned developers, it’s safe to say that goal has been achieved.</p>
            <h2>What is C# Used For?</h2>
            <p>Like other general-purpose programming languages, C# can be used to create a number of different programs and <br>applications: mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud-based services, websites, enterprise software and games. Lots and lots <br>of games. While C# is remarkably versatile, there are three areas in which it is most commonly used.</p>
            <h3>Games</h3>
            <p>This language is heavily used to create fan-favorite games like Rimworld on the Unity Game Engine. Just in case you weren’t <br>already aware, Unity is by far the most popular game engine available, on which more than a third of the industry’s best and <br>most commonly-played games were built. C# integrates seamlessly with the Unity engine and can be used on virtually any <br>modern mobile device or console thanks to cross-platform tech like Xamarin.</p>
            <h3>Website Development</h3>
            <p>C# is often used to develop professional, dynamic websites on the .NET platform, or open-source software. So, even if you’re <br>not a fan of the Microsoft architecture, you can still use C# to create a fully-functional website. Because this language is <br>object-oriented, it is often utilized to develop websites that are incredibly efficient, easily scalable and a breeze to maintain.</p>
            <h3>Windows Applications</h3>
            <p>C# was created by Microsoft for Microsoft, so it’s easy to see why it’s most popularly used for the development of Windows <br>desktop applications. C# applications require the Windows .NET framework in order to function at their best, so the strongest <br>use case for this language is developing applications and programs that are specific to the architecture of the Microsoft platform.</p>
