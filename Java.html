            <h1>The Popular Language</h1>
            <h2>What is Java?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java is a general purpose programming language, much like Python or JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>The language itself is specifically an object oriented programming language, so bears similarities to C++, C#.</li>
                    <li>Java is also a platform, which means that Java code can run on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) <br>on it. Originally those two things were interchangeable, and the only thing that ran on the JVM was Java. But since <br>that time, a number of languages have been written which can run on the Java platform, languages like Scala, Groovy, <br>an implementation of Ruby called jRuby, and an implementation of Python called Jython.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Brief History of Java</h2>
                <p>Java was created by a team at Sun Microsystems, was released in 1995 and was subsequently acquired by Oracle. A <br>primary goal of the Java creators was to develop a language that could run on consumer appliances – so the designers <br>were already contemplating a world in which there was code running on your refrigerator or toaster – what we now call <br><b>the internet of things</b>. We’ve only recently started creating devices which benefit from such a language, so in the mid-1990s, <br>they were way ahead of their time. But that goal drove a lot of the architecture of Java. One of its major selling points was <br>“write once, run anywhere,” so in other words you could write one piece of code, then it could be compiled to run on any device.</p>
                <p>Ironically, Java did not gain popularity for that reason; instead its creators were able to take advantage of something else that <br>came out in the mid-1990s: the world wide web. Java had a feature where you could write things called applets, small programs <br>which could run inside of a web browser, and as the web was gaining popularity, Java rode that wave and became extremely <br>successful and popular. So a lot of web applications were written in Java, even though that wasn’t what the creators had in mind <br>when they first conceived the language.</p>
                <p><b>The creators of Java were strongly influenced by existing programming languages like C and C++</b>, with which Java shares a lot of <br>syntactic similarities. They used these languages as an example of how not to do things, so there were certain features that the <br>creators of Java explicitly decided not to include, because they had been troublesome for programmers using C and C++.</p>
            <h2>Why Java is a Great Coding Language For Beginners.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java has been around for such a long time, so it’s really well established. There are a lot of great books, online resources.</li>
                    <li>There are probably more Java programmers than any other type of programmer in the world, so a lot of people already know <br>Java and it’s easy to find people who can help you out and mentor you.</li>
                    <li>Java derives its syntax from C, and lots of other languages also derive their syntax from C, so if you learn Java, then learning <br>a language like Javascript, C#, or C++ is much easier.</li>
                    <li>It’s an object-oriented language, so a lot of the foundational concepts you learn inside of Java are transferable to other <br>languages.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Uber</li>
                    <li>Airbnb</li>
                    <li>Google</li>
                    <li>Amazon</li>

            <h2>Java vs Javascript</h2>
                <p>Despite having similar names, both Java and JavaScript are written, assembled and executed differently, and each has dramatic <br>differences when it comes to what it is capable of doing.</p>
                <p>Java is used in a wide range of places, including Android apps, credit card programming and in the creation of desktop applications <br>and web enterprise applications. By comparison, JavaScript is mainly used to make web pages more interactive. It can be used as <br>an alternative to Flash, though most programmers will tell you that JavaScript is more popular and has more functionality than Flash. <br>JavaScript can be used to do neat things like creating animation in HTML.</p>

                <span>Along with this:</span>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>Java code must be compiled, and JavaScript code is all-text.</li>
                        <li>Each language requires different plug-ins.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript code is run on a browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.</li>
                        <li>Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.</li>
