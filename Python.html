            <h1>The Universal Language</h1>
            <h2>What is Python?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is a backend programming language that’s great for beginners.</li>
                <li>Python is similar in many ways to Ruby, but is less verbose than other programming languages - a little less wordy.</li>
                <li>Python is a web programming language, so it interfaces with the internet. It knows how to receive and send web requests<br> and talk to databases.</li>
                <li>Python can be used for scripting, web scraping, and creating data sets. It’s popular in the scientific community for scientific<br> computing; there are libraries that make it easy to share academic code projects in Python.</li>
                <li>The Python community is welcoming, well-maintained, and well-documented. That’s important for a beginner!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Brief History of Python</h2>
            <p>Python was originally conceptualized by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a member of the National Research Institute<br> of Mathematics and Computer Science. Initially, it was designed as a response to the ABC programming language that was also<br> foregrounded in the Netherlands. Among the main features of Python compared to the ABC language was that Python had<br> exceptional handling and was targeted for the Amoeba operating system.</p>
            <p>Of course, Python, like other languages, has gone through a number of versions. Python 0.9.0 was first released in 1991. In<br> addition to exceptional handling, Python included classes, lists, and strings. More importantly, it included lambda, map, filter<br> and reduce (JavaScript anyone?), which aligned it heavily in relation to functional programming.</p>
            <p>In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. This version of was more of an open-source project from members of the National Research<br> Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science. This version of Python included list comprehensions, a full garbage collector, <br>and it supported Unicode.</p>
            <p>Python 3.0 was the next version and was released in December of 2008 (the latest version of Python is 3.6.4). Although Python <br>2 and 3 are similar there are subtle differences. Perhaps most noticeably is the way the print statement works, as in Python 3.0 <br>the print statement has been replaced with a print () function.</p>
            <h2>Why is Python a great first coding language for beginners?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python syntax is very similar to English, so it’s intuitive, which helps you understand what’s going on. You don't have to look <br>up what symbols mean when you use Python. Here’s an example:</li>
                <li>Python is so readable that even if a company’s entire code base isn’t written in Python, developers tend to want to write code<br> in Python.</li>
                <li>Python will be a marketable skill if you join any software engineering team because you’ll know how to create something that<br> is well-maintained and well-received by your team.</li>
                <li>Python programmers are among the most highly paid, which is encouraging, especially if you’re considering starting a career in<br> software engineering.</li>
