            <h1>The Web-Interactive Language</h1>
            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex <br>animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, <br>which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between <br>multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its <br>environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as <br>operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with <br>additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li><em>Client-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). <br>For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as <br>mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li><em>Server-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, <br>server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation <br>to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the <br>server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>
            <h2>Brief History of Javascript</h2>
            <p>Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995 while he was at Netscape Communications Corporation, the creators of the legendary <br>Netscape Navigator web browser. At the time, the Java coding language was rapidly gaining traction and Netscape Communications <br>was working to make it available in Netscape Communicator.</p>
            <p>However, Java was too large and too complex to appeal to amateurs, scripters, and designers. In order to solve this problem, Netscape <br>Communications contracted Brendan Eich to design a versatile programming language that could speed up web development and serve <br>as a scripting companion for Java. And yet, instead of being just a Scheme for Netscape Navigator, JavaScript went on to become <br>something much bigger.</p>
            <p>The early versions of JavaScript were called Mocha. Not long after a Mocha prototype was introduced into Netscape Communicator <br>(May 1995), it was renamed to LiveScript, purely because the world Live was better for marketing. It was renamed again in <br>December of the same year, this time into JavaScript.</p>
            <p>This first version of JavaScript defined the many great traits (such as its object-model) this coding language is known for today. It also <br>boasted a number of powerful features that would eventually enable it to outgrow its original purpose.</p>
            <span>These features include:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>First-class object functions</li>
                <li>Syntax that is similar to Java</li>
                <li>Prototype-based object model</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What is Javascript used for?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Adding interactivity to websites</b>—yup, if you want a website to be more than a static page of text, you’ll need to do some <br>JavaScripting</li>
                <li><b>Developing mobile applications</b>—JavaScript isn’t just for websites…it’s used to create those apps you have on your phone and <br>tablet as well</li>
                <li><b>Creating web browser based games</b>—Ever played a game directly from your web browser? JavaScript probably helped make <br>that happen</li>
                <li><b>Back end web development</b>—yeah, JavaScript is MOSTLY used on the front end of things, but it’s a versatile enough scripting <br>language to be used on back end infrastructure, too.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How Does Javascript Work?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is either embedded into a web page or else it’s included in a .js file. JavaScript is also a “client-side” language (rather than <br>a “server-side” language), which is a fancy way of saying that it gets downloaded to site visitors’ computers, then processed.</p>
